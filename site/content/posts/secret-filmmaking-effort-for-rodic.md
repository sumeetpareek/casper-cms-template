## Mission

I find that it helps to write down the mission and the purpose of an effort. Especially if you are planning to work on something new. And even more so if what you plan to work on, gets you _really_ excited, and makes you _mighthy_ afraid, both at the same time.

<!--more-->

Coming back to a written down purpose helps when you are riding a rollercoaster of invigorating excitement and soul crushing fear, and 99% of new entrepreneurial ventures have no way to avoid such a ride.

All of these things apply to our secret filmmaking efforts, so before I delve into the details of it, let me start by writing down what the misson is:

> We are not from the world of professional filmmaking. Not yet. So as complete outsiders, our team's mission is to make a compelling 2 hour long film, code named RODIC, and get it to play across 1000+ theatre screens in the US and India, before the end of year 2020.

Fuck! That does not sound like it will be easy :confounded::cold_sweat:

I mean making a compelling 2 hour long film requires many art forms to come together. Writing, TODO.

> We want to do this so that everybody on the team can then go on to make more films.

## Next Heading

TODO. Write details here.
